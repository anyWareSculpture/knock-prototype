Manual testing against server:

1) Connect two players


telnet theroom.kintel.net 7000          # ..or evol.local
{"login": "myself"}                     # Server should register the login
telnet theroom.kintel.net 7000
{"login": "other"}                      # Server should register the login

In any window:
{"proximity": 1}                        # Server should enter call state
                                        # -> boxes should start knocking


In any window:
{"knockpattern": [1000, 500]}           # -> Open sesame
