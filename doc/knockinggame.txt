Assuming computer is just a router

* Wait until we're online (poll?)
* Send login (get ack)

* On received message: Call corresponding function

* On received input: Send corresponding message

* Not (yet) any state machine for system/game state apart from what's necessary to perform actions

First try:
* assume we're online
* send login without ack
* start game
