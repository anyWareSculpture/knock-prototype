The router is some device talking serial to the arduino and TCP with
the server, and is responsible for routing traffic between them, as
well as managing the connection and keeping it alive.


Arduino -> server:
o Open serial port
o Wait for ready command
o For each read arduino message:
  - convert to JSON
  - send to server

Server -> arduino:
o Open TCP port
o Send connect command
o Wait for connect response (to validate protocol version etc.)
o For each read server message
  - convert to Arduino Cmd
  - send to Arduino


TODO:
o Write a proof-of-concept node.js program to talk to the Arduino
  - Serial port name
  - baud rate
  - s = new serial.SerialPort(name, {baudrate: rate, parser: serial.parsers.readline('\n')}
  - s.on('data', function(data) { }
  - s.write(<string>)
